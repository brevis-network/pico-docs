Welcome to Pico—the open-source zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) that transforms how developers build secure, scalable, and high-performance decentralized applications. Drawing on the innovative ["glue-and-coprocessor"](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/09/02/gluecp.html) architecture, Pico fuses the efficiency of specialized circuits with the adaptability of a general-purpose zkVM. This unique design empowers you to craft tailored proof systems that meet the diverse needs of modern cryptographic applications.

Pico’s design is rooted in the need for adaptable, high-performance ZK systems that can keep pace with the rapidly evolving landscape of cryptographic research. Rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all solution, Pico’s modular architecture lets you:

* **Leverage Interchangeable Proving Backends:** Select from multiple proving backends to achieve the best performance and efficiency.
* **Integrate App-Specific Circuits:** Seamlessly incorporate specialized circuits/coprocessors to accelerate domain-specific computations.
* **Customize Proving Workflows:** Assemble and fine-tune proof generation pipelines tailored to your application’s specific requirements.

## Why Choose Pico?

Pico is built upon four fundamental strengths that set it apart:

* **Modularity:** Pico’s architecture is composed of independent, interchangeable components. This design allows you to configure and reassemble the system to align with your application’s requirements precisely.
* **Flexibility:** Pico supports various proving backends and custom proving pipelines, enabling you to fine-tune every aspect of the proof generation process. Adjust parameters effortlessly to meet specific performance demands.
* **Extensibility:** Designed for seamless integration, Pico allows you to incorporate app-specific circuits and custom acceleration modules. This extensibility ensures you can add bespoke coprocessors or precompiles, enhancing the system’s capabilities without disrupting its core functionality.
* **Performance:** Engineered for efficiency, Pico achieves industry-leading proof generation speeds on standard hardware. Its optimized workflows and specialized circuits deliver exceptional throughput and low latency, even in high-demand scenarios.

Pico provides a robust, future-ready foundation that meets today’s challenges and evolves with the advancing field of zero-knowledge technology. Whether you’re a developer eager to explore the potential of ZK proofs or a researcher pushing the boundaries of cryptographic innovation, Pico is the ideal platform to build upon.
